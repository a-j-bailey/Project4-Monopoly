	-	When a player goes to jail, the game tells them they're in jail 
			and then they have to hit the "end turn" Button
			Also, have a message that tells the player when they go to jail and when they get out of jail
			Right now, When you don't roll doubles when in jail, you have to click "roll Dice" twice. Make a message for that
	-	Adjust the wording on some rules. (I don't know if he'll grade for this, but better safe than sorry)
			i.e. Bankruptcy: Everything goes to the bank, not the debtor. 
	-	Fix having to "Roll Dice" twice while in jail
