[Done]	Allow players to roll to get out of jail when it would be there turn.
			But don't move their token unless it's doubles.
[Done]	Make tokens go to jail as soon as they land on that location. 
			Currently you have to "roll dice" again
	-	Allow players to use a get out of jail free card (if they have it)
			I'll add a button to "use card" to the GUI (Adam).

	-	Only refund half the cost of houses if their sold
	-	When a player goes to jail, the game tells them they're in jail 
			and then they have to hit the "end turn" Button
			Also, have a message that tells the player when they go to jail and when they get out of jail
			Right now, When you don't roll doubles when in jail, you have to click "roll Dice" twice. Make a message for that
